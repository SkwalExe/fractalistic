# The Logs Panel ðŸ“œ

To go beyond the exploration of basic fractals, you'll need to use the command system. While the next section will delve into this topic in detail, let's first take a look at the logs panel.

The logs panel is a crucial part of the command system, as it is used to display all the generated information. Understanding its features and how to interact with it is essential.

### Scrolling through the logs

There are several ways of scrolling through the output in the logs panel. 
- Using your **mouse wheel** on the component
- using the **`up` and `down` arrow keys**
- using advanced control keys like **`Home`, `End`, `PageUp` and `PageDown` .**

This is pretty straightforward, but now comes the tricky part.

### Copying output

At various occasions, you may want to copy output from the logs panel, for example, if you want to share coordinates, printed using the `pos` command.
However, because of how the application's interface works, **you will not be able to simply select some text and copy it** like you would in typical terminal programs.

The terminal content is continuously being refreshed to update parts of the screen, making text selection a little complicated. But nothing that we can't fix! You still have 2 possibilities for copying text.

- The first way is to freeze the terminal content by using **the text selection feature.** Most terminal emulators provide this function, where holding `Shift` or `Alt` while selecting text will **freeze the content or ignore updates.** This allows you to copy the desired portion. You may also want to use this in combination with the **block selection** feature, where also pressing `Ctrl` at the same time will allow you to select **a block instead of lines of text.**

- Another way to copy text is to do it when quitting the app. If Fractalistic is terminated correctly, either by pressing `Ctrl+C` or by using the `quit` command, the logs history will be printed to the terminal upon exit, allowing you to copy text like you normally would.
