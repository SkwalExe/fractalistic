## How to install ðŸ“¥ {#installation}

You can install fractalistic easily with pip:


```bash
pip install fractalistic
```

If you want to install the application and its dependencies in an isolated environment, you can use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```bash
pipx install fractalistic
```

## Starting the app

::: info Caution
If the command is not found after installation, you may need to add  `~/.local/bin` to your path. You can do this by adding `export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file. You will also need to **open a new shell session**.

```bash
# For bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && bash
# For zsh
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc && zsh
```
:::

Now you can start the application with this command:

```bash
fractalistic
```
