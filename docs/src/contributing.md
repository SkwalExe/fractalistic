# Contributing 🫂

### You found a bug, or you need help 🆘

Please, open an issue if you have any suggestion or if you found a bug. I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
You can also open an issue if you need help, I will always be happy to help someone interested in my projects!

[You can open an issue on the project's Github repository. 🐙](https://github.com/SkwalExe/fractalistic/issues)

### You want to contribute 🧑‍💻

If you want to contribute, **open an empty pull request and explain what you want to do first.**
Then, wait for me to approve it and then you can start working on it.
This is very important, it is always heart-breaking to reject a pull 
request that someone has invested a lot of time and efforts into. 🙁
